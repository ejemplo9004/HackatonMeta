# HackatonMeta

Inmerstories creates a unique ‘step by step’ approach that transforms a complex discourse into a playful narrative. It works because it leverages the humans sequence learning ability to better experience stories.

On the technical side, Wit.ai offers speech recognition and voice control as part of "PRESENCE PLATFORM", which enables Inmerstories to create a playful experience where the user is responsible for making the story flow, while practicing the second language. 


Setup is as easy as intalling the APK in your VR device.
Here we used Oculus Quest 2.

Here you can find the APK file:
https://github.com/ejemplo9004/HackatonMeta/tree/main/APK


Please note that you should allow the installation of unknown apps within the 'developer mode' since this is an experimental product for the purpose of THE XR HACKATHON (Nov 9-22, 2021) at https://www.facebookhackathons.com/

Once you are inside the Inmerstories world, you can use your left hand index to start controlling the system.
