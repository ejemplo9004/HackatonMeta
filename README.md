# Inmmerstories

Inmmerstories is a novel APP that intensifies stories and empower language learners through the lens of Virtual Reality.

This demo shows our product concept applied to the task of assisting learners of Spanish as a second language in a reading activity. Our stories become an immersive, interactive and animated experience that helps learners to better understand the intended message.

Inmerstories aims to reinvent the way we acquire our language, or a second one; the way we learn new historical or touristic facts; and beyond, to transform the way we present visual ideas.

We used Wit.ai capabilities for speech recognition and voice control as part of the  the Voice SDK provided by PRESENCE PLATFORM, which enables our product to create a playful experience where the user is responsible for making the story flow through her voice interaction, while practicing the second language.

Setup is as easy as installing the APK in your VR device.
Here we used Oculus Quest 2.

Please note that you should allow the installation of unknown apps within the 'developer mode' since this is an experimental product for the purpose of THE XR HACKATHON (Nov 9-22, 2021) at https://www.facebookhackathons.com/

Once you are inside the Inmerstories world, you can use your left hand index to start controlling the system.
